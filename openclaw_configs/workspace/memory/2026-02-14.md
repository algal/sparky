# 2026-02-14 — Tool Introspection Session

Alexis ran a "tool debug" session exploring what I can see about my own capabilities.

## Key findings

- **Tools vs Skills**: I have ~25 tools (structured, callable) and ~17 skills (markdown instructions I read then execute via exec). Tools are easier to use; skills are more flexible and easier to create.
- **Emacs tools**: 6 tools prefixed `emacs_` (list/open/read/insert/edit/eval). Alexis built this plugin. From my side they appear as a flat list — I can't see the plugin grouping.
- **Nodes**: `nodes status` shows 5 paired nodes. When disconnected, minimal info (name/platform/IP). When connected, full details appear (caps, commands, permissions). Current nodes: arrow (Mac), agent (Linux), alexis-mac (Darwin, disconnected), Reachy Mini Lite (Linux), plus a duplicate arrow entry on 127.0.0.1.
- **Session key**: Not directly visible to me. Found via `sessions_list` — our session is `agent:sparky:tool-debug`.
- **Channel blindness**: Everything shows as `channel: "webchat"` — TUI, browser, and voice interface are all indistinguishable. The `reachy` voice session also shows as webchat. Valid non-webchat channels would be telegram, discord, signal, whatsapp, slack, imessage — but none are configured here.
- **Session introspection is slightly recursive**: `sessions_list` shows my own in-progress tool call in the message history.

## Alexis's interest
He's exploring how OpenClaw's abstractions look from the agent's perspective — what's visible, what's hidden, what's misleading (like channel=webchat for everything).
